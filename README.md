# EGBI222 Pair Project - The Complete Titanic Dataset

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic Dataset using python. It is designed as cousework for EGBI222 Computer Programming (Academic Yaer 2025), created by **Tanutchaporn Snguanwongwan (6713368)** and **Nareekarn Sotana (6713370)**

## Project Overview

The notebook mainly includes:
- Setting up the environment in Google Colab  
- Loading and exploring the **Titanic Dataset**  
- Data cleaning and summary statistics  
- Basic visualization using **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn**

## Running the Code

You can run the notebook directly on Google Colab:

[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1f_rf6wtJlX4wxIMPJMhH-so75NPBNdZA)

### Steps

1. **Download the Dataset**
   - Titanic Dataset: [Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vinicius150987/titanic3) 
   - Save the dataset (CSV file) to your Google Drive

2. **Update the File Path**
   - In the notebook, set the correct path to your dataset:
     '''python
     file_paths = "your-path-to-dataset"
     df = pd.read_csv(file_paths)
     '''
     


3. **Run All Cells**
   - The notebook will guide you through mounting Google Drive, importing libraries, loading data, and performing EDA.
